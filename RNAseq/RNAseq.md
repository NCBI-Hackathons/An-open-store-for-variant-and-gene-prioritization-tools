# RNA-seq (RNA sequencing)

Sources of single cell RNA-seq expression data. RNA-seq is a transcriptome profiling approach that uses deep-sequencing technologies, provding a far more precise measurement of levels of transcripts and their isoforms than other methods.

Three outputs:
1. var_position = The variant's genomic position along the chromosome as in the range [0,1], where 0 is the first position of the chromosome, and 1 is the last.
2. The reference bases, with nucleotide abbreviations expanded to full names such that `ATG` becomes `AdenineThymineGuanine` .
3. ref_len = The number of bases in the reference.
