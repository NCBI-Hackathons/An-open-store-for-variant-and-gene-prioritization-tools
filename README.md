# An open store for variant and gene prioritization tools

## Introduction 

Open-CRAVAT is a python package that performs genomic variant interpretation. The modular and locally-installed command-line or GUI interface allows for  annoations of gene- and variant-level impact, interactions, conservation, and scoring. In this work, we advance the platform by the addition of new annoation sources to assist in the interrogation of genetic variation.
