## Introduction 

Open-CRAVAT is a python package that performs genomic variant interpretation. The modular and locally-installed command-line or GUI interface allows for  annoations of gene- and variant-level impact, interactions, conservation, and scoring. In this work, we advance the platform by the addition of new annoation sources to assist in the interrogation of genetic variation.

## Installation 

For local installation on Mac and Windows see the Quickstart guide here: https://github.com/KarchinLab/open-cravat/wiki/quickstart

## Goal and flowchart

(1) Add in sources of single cell RNA-seq expression data <br>
(2) Additional representation for under-studied populations

To accomplish these tasks, we will need to carefully format the data and generate several accessory files necessary for incorporation into OpenCRAVAT
