Three outputs:
1. var_ position = The variant's genomic position along the chromosome as in the range [0,1], where 0 is the first position of the chromosome, and 1 is the last.
2. verbose_ref = The reference bases, with nucleotide abbreviations expanded to full names such that `ATG` becomes `AdenineThymineGuanine` .
3. ref_len = The number of bases in the reference.
